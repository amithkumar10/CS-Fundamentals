# CS-Fundamentals 🧠

Hey there! This repository is my personal collection of core Computer Science concepts — notes, code snippets, and problem-solving patterns that I’ve compiled while learning and revising.

It’s mainly meant to help me stay sharp on CS fundamentals for interviews, system design, and overall technical growth 🚀

## 📘 What's Inside
- **OOP** – Concepts with examples.
- **OS, DBMS, CN** – Quick theory.
- **System Design** – Beginner-level notes.
- **Important C++ Concepts** - Generally not studied by most


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Primarily written in **C++** with occasional notes in Markdown.

## 🤓 Why I Made This

I built this repo for my own revision and learning. It keeps me consistent and gives me a clean space to revisit important concepts quickly — especially before interviews or while mentoring juniors.

Feel free to explore — and if something helps you too, that's a bonus!
